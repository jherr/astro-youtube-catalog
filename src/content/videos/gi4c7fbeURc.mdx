Astro 2.0 has done it again! They've taken what was already a great Islands Architecture framework that supported React, Preact, Vue, Solid and more, and they have added a new type-safe CMS feature called content collections that makes building blogs, corporate sites, portfolio sites and more so much easier. They have also enabled a Static Site Generation or Server Side Rendering switch on a per-route basis.
