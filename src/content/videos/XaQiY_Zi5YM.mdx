Nobody writes pro-level polished code for a new feature in the first go. Step 1; get it working. Step 2; get it right. Step 3: polish it up. If you hold yourself to a "first pass is going to be super polished perfect code" you'll never write the quantity of code you need to be a senior level developer.
